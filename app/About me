Hi I am Aakash.I have around 4 years of experience as mobile developer and web developer.
I started my career in 2015 as an Android developer and from time to time I upgrade my skills.
Right now, I am working on a lubricants project. To automate a loyalty program for mechanics.
I love to solve complex coding problems, making UI, writing design pattern for apps in my free time.
I have experience working as a freelancing. 
I can also work with python to build an API and plot a graph to make decisions based on data. 
I always want to learn something that makes me busy with programming.I will be glad to connect with you. Thank you.
